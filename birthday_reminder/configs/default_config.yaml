# If use_time is false, the event is full-day, and it uses time_zone from the calendar settings. Please set them manually because API doesn't allow to set them automatically.
time_zone: UTC # time zone for the event. If use_time is False, this setting is ignored. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones for a list of time zones

remind_29_feb_on_1_mar: false # this is a workaround for Google Calendar to display reminders for birthdays in non-leap years.
# If false, the reminder will be set on 28 Feb. If true, the reminder will be set on 1 Mar.

# popup reminders for the event. Time in minutes is counted from the event start.
# One problem with that is that if you set a reminder only before event start.
# So, if the event is full-day, you can get reminder in the day of the birthday at 00:00, but not later.
# Usually it's not a very big problem - you just get a reminder at 00:00 and if you sleep - the popup (and email) notification waits for you in the morning.
# If you want to get a reminder at the day of the birthday, say at 10:00, you need enable use_time and set event_time to 10:00
